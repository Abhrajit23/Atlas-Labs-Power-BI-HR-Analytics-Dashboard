# 📊 Atlas Labs | Power BI HR Analytics Dashboard

A fully interactive and executive-ready HR analytics dashboard built in Power BI. This project analyzes employee demographics, performance, and attrition to support data-driven HR strategies at a fictional company, **Atlas Labs**.

## ❓ Problem Statement

HR teams often face challenges understanding workforce trends, tracking employee satisfaction, and identifying the root causes of attrition. Without consolidated, insightful visualizations, strategic workforce planning becomes reactive rather than proactive.

* Track headcount and hiring trends
* Explore workforce demographics across age, gender, and ethnicity

Advanced DAX, slicers, and conditional formatting provide an interactive experience that mimics real business scenarios.
